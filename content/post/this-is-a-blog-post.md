# Das Außerzeitliche


I dont want to be writing too much about it, only having read a 100 pages of ~4 thousand. It is a fictional autobiography and definitely a literary text and not a philosophical one, all though it has some theoretical thoughts in it.

I have the feeling it is a very deep read not just in literal sense (7 books) but in what it is about. 
To give a short example: the quest about the lost time: a theme of the book is that Marcel has flashbacks, he reminds suddenly about a moment in the past, and these few seconds are described in hundreds of pages. There is a huge discrepancy between time that you spend to read it an time that passes in the book, lost time in a literal sense. 

But what is lost time in a, lets call it in a deeper, abstract sense? 

"The being who then felt this joyful impression in me felt it in what this had in common with the past and now, in what it had in common with the outside; 
it was a being who only appeared when, because of such an identity between present and past, he was placed in the only element of life where he could exist
and enjoy the essence of things, that is, outside time. This explains why my worries about my death came to an end at the moment when I unconsciously recognised
the taste of little Madeleine; for at that moment the being that I had been was an extra-temporal being and was therefore unconcerned about the vicissitudes of 
the future.
...
It was the only one with the power to make me rediscover the days of yore, the lost time, while the efforts of my memory and my mind always failed."

The moments that are "außerzeitlich", out of time are the only ones that let Marcel rediscover the lost time, in the moment he eats the Madelaine he so vividly remembers 
the past that he forgets about time and temporality, youth, age and death. 

Time seems to be a recurring theme, I read a part, where Marcel, after he was 20 years living alone, steps back into the Paris high society. The description is so comical, 
a mix between a homage and a tear-off of this social group and lifestyle that i when reading first didnt even get it! He described the aging of the people as if they were 
doing a mascerade, a cynical description of what really happened. People just aged 20 years, Marcel included :). 

# About literature

Marcel also thinks about literature and the task of a writer itself, something that I reckon could interest you. I will let him speak for himself, as I can not phrase it much better, and I am a bit tired just now. 

'The reality that had to be expressed was - this was now clear to me - not in the external aspect of the object, but in a depth in which this external symbolized by the sound of the spoon on a plate and the starch-laden stiffness of the napkin, both of which were of little importance for my  spiritual renewal were more valuable than so many humanitarian, patriotic, internationalist and metaphysical entertainments' 
That is something that I deeply agree with and for me differentiates great art from the rest. 

About the writer itself Marcel is writing:

'I had already come to the conclusion that we are by no means free in relation to the work of art, that we do not create it at our own discretion, that it is rather 
already exists before us, necessary but hidden, and therefore we must actually discover it, as we would do with a law of nature'


'I noticed that a great writer is not inventing this essential book, this only true book, in the common sense, but, since it already exists in each of us 
exists, must translate. The duty and task of a writer are those of a translator'

And about the reader: 

'Because the personal root of our own impression is not taken into account. Every impression is double: Half of it is in the object, and half of it is in us through a the other half, which only we could know; but it is precisely in those moments in which we are the most disinterested observers of nature, society, love or even of art, we hurry to neglect this second half...until, in that flight from our own life which we do not want to. How many of them leave it at that, drawing nothing from their impressions, aging uselessly and joylessly, as bachelors of art, so to speak!'


Marcel is the fictional character of the book. We can not take everything he thinks directly as Prousts thoughts of course. My prof called this the 'literarization of a thought process'. Most of what Marcel thinks is far from correct, in a logical, philosophical sense, you could critize it, if you truly would want. But why would you do this? This is not philosophy, this is not about wanting to be right but rather to show the reader a different perspective, to give the possibility of diving into the world of Marcel and not about finding truth.

I am sorry for the translations by the way. I used a programm and didnt do it myself. I feel like its a bit difficult to read now but I hope you can still understand. I guess you should read it in french one day :).

What a read Mari! I can not even imagine 4000 pages but its certainly something i feel that once in life, one can take on, even though it probably takes years to finish. My favorite line is ,For the true paradises are the paradises you have lost.' I will stop here but there is so many more things that you can talk about, as i already wrote you, another theme that i discovered is the ambivalence of humans and our moral and behaviour.
A lot to read, think and talk about.
